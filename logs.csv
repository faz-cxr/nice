How to manage vitilligo?,"Management of vitiligo depends on the person's age, disease subtype, distribution, activity, and extent. The aim of management is to improve the appearance of the skin and to prevent further depigmentation. The following are the management options for vitiligo:

1. Providing advice on sources of information and support.
2. Advising on sun protection.
3. Managing any psychosocial co-morbidities.
4. Offering short-term potent topical corticosteroid treatment to adults with non-facial localized, non-segmental disease if there are no contraindications.
5. Arranging regular review to assess treatment response and monitor for adverse effects.
6. Arranging further investigation or referral for associated autoimmune disease, if appropriate.
7. Arranging referral to a dermatologist for specialist management if the diagnosis is uncertain, or treatment in primary care is inappropriate or unsuccessful.
8. Offering referral to a skin camouflage service, if appropriate.

Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for localized vitiligo. They are most effective when used on the face, neck, and flexures. The treatment should be continued for at least 3 months, and the response should be assessed after 6 months. Other topical treatments that can be used include calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriol.

In cases of extensive vitiligo, phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) can be used. These treatments can be effective in inducing repigmentation, but they require multiple sessions and can cause adverse effects such as erythema, pruritus, and blistering.

Surgical treatments such as autologous melanocyte transplantation, suction blister grafting, and split-thickness skin grafting can be considered in cases of stable vitiligo that has not responded to other treatments.","

What is angle closure glaucoma? Can you explain it as a rap in the style of Eminem?,"Sure, I can explain angle closure glaucoma, but I'm not sure if I can do it in the style of Eminem. I'll give it a try anyway! ðŸŽ¤

Angle closure glaucoma, let me break it down
It's a type of glaucoma that can make you frown
It happens when the angle between iris and cornea is closed
And the fluid in your eye can't flow, so the pressure goes up, exposed

It's more common in people who are long-sighted, Asian, or old
And if you have a history of blurred vision, headaches, or eye pain, be bold
If you see halos around lights, especially at night
And you feel nausea, vomiting, and your eye is tender and tight

It's a medical emergency, don't wait
Go to the hospital, don't hesitate
They'll give you drops and pills to lower the pressure
And relieve the pain, so you can feel better

If you don't treat it, you can lose your sight
So don't ignore the symptoms, do what's right
See a doctor, get a check-up, and stay healthy
And you'll avoid angle closure glaucoma, that's the key!

The following are the management options:

1. Diabetes Management:
   - Ensure that the patient has an individualized care plan, which includes lifestyle measures such as diet, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse.
   - Offer referral to a structured group education program.
   - Advise on sources of information and support.
   - Advise on how to manage intercurrent illness and 'sick-day rules'.
   - Assess for associated psychosocial problems and offer support.
   - Advise on sexual health, contraception, and pre-pregnancy counseling, if appropriate.
   - Offer immunization against influenza and pneumococcal infection, if indicated.
   - Advise on the importance of regular HbA1c monitoring, antidiabetic drug treatment (if appropriate), and individualized treatment targets, to reduce the risk of long-term complications.
   - Advise against routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.
   - Advise on the importance of regular screening for complications, how to reduce risk, and offering management as appropriate.

2. Hypertension Management:
   - Offer lifestyle advice, including advice on diet and exercise, stress management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (if applicable).
   - Consider the need for antihypertensive drug treatment, which is initiated in a stepwise approach.
   - Consider the need for statin treatment, following cardiovascular risk assessment.
   - Monitor response to lifestyle changes and drug treatment.
   - Review the person annually to monitor blood pressure, review medication, provide support, and discuss lifestyle, symptoms, and treatment(s).

3. CVD Risk Assessment and Management:
   - Assess the person's 10-year CVD risk using the QRISK assessment tool every 5 years.
   - Offer lifestyle advice, regardless of their risk score.
   - Offer statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD to people with an estimated 10-year CVD risk of 10% or more if lifestyle interventions have not proved effective.
   - Atorvastatin 20 mg a day is the recommended statin if the person decides to take drug treatment after an informed discussion about benefits and harms, after having been provided with lifestyle advice, and if there are no contraindications.","- https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/diabetes-type-2/

"A 4 week old boy has episodes of vomiting since birth. The vomiting occurs soon after feeding. He does not vomit after every feed and it is not related to the amount he takes. He is otherwise well and is gaining weight appropriately.
 
Which is the most likely diagnosis?

Cows milk protein allergy

Gastro-oesophageal reflux

 Lactose intolerance

Pyloric stenosis

Urinary tract infection","Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). 

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus. It is considered physiological in infants when symptoms are absent or not troublesome. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in children is the presence of troublesome symptoms (for example discomfort or pain) or complications (such as oesophagitis or pulmonary aspiration) arising from GOR. GORD should be suspected in infants presenting with regurgitation and one or more of the following: distressed behaviour shown, for example, by excessive crying, crying while feeding, and adopting unusual neck postures; hoarseness and/or chronic cough; a single episode of pneumonia; unexplained feeding difficulties; and faltering growth. GORD usually begins before the age of 8 weeks and resolves in 90% of infants before they are 1 year of age. 

Cows milk protein allergy is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism. Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood. Almost all cases present before one year of age. Typical symptoms include urticaria, angio-oedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, or breathlessness after cow's milk ingestion. 

Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is caused by a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme produced by the cells lining the small intestine. Symptoms include bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. 

Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the muscle between the stomach and small intestine (pylorus) becomes thickened, blocking the passage of food. It usually presents in the first few weeks of life with projectile vomiting, weight loss, and dehydration. 

Urinary tract infection is an infection in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms include fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhoea.","
