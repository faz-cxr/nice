How to manage vitilligo?,"Management of vitiligo depends on the person's age, disease subtype, distribution, activity, and extent. The aim of management is to improve the appearance of the skin and to prevent further depigmentation. The following are the management options for vitiligo:

1. Providing advice on sources of information and support.
2. Advising on sun protection.
3. Managing any psychosocial co-morbidities.
4. Offering short-term potent topical corticosteroid treatment to adults with non-facial localized, non-segmental disease if there are no contraindications.
5. Arranging regular review to assess treatment response and monitor for adverse effects.
6. Arranging further investigation or referral for associated autoimmune disease, if appropriate.
7. Arranging referral to a dermatologist for specialist management if the diagnosis is uncertain, or treatment in primary care is inappropriate or unsuccessful.
8. Offering referral to a skin camouflage service, if appropriate.

Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for localized vitiligo. They are most effective when used on the face, neck, and flexures. The treatment should be continued for at least 3 months, and the response should be assessed after 6 months. Other topical treatments that can be used include calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriol.

In cases of extensive vitiligo, phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) can be used. These treatments can be effective in inducing repigmentation, but they require multiple sessions and can cause adverse effects such as erythema, pruritus, and blistering.

Surgical treatments such as autologous melanocyte transplantation, suction blister grafting, and split-thickness skin grafting can be considered in cases of stable vitiligo that has not responded to other treatments.

What is angle closure glaucoma? Can you explain it as a rap in the style of Eminem?,"Sure, I can explain angle closure glaucoma, but I'm not sure if I can do it in the style of Eminem. I'll give it a try anyway! ðŸŽ¤

Angle closure glaucoma, let me break it down
It's a type of glaucoma that can make you frown
It happens when the angle between iris and cornea is closed
And the fluid in your eye can't flow, so the pressure goes up, exposed

It's more common in people who are long-sighted, Asian, or old
And if you have a history of blurred vision, headaches, or eye pain, be bold
If you see halos around lights, especially at night
And you feel nausea, vomiting, and your eye is tender and tight

It's a medical emergency, don't wait
Go to the hospital, don't hesitate
They'll give you drops and pills to lower the pressure
And relieve the pain, so you can feel better

If you don't treat it, you can lose your sight
So don't ignore the symptoms, do what's right
See a doctor, get a check-up, and stay healthy
And you'll avoid angle closure glaucoma, that's the key!
