How to manage vitilligo?,"Management of vitiligo depends on the person's age, disease subtype, distribution, activity, and extent. The aim of management is to improve the appearance of the skin and to prevent further depigmentation. The following are the management options for vitiligo:

1. Providing advice on sources of information and support.
2. Advising on sun protection.
3. Managing any psychosocial co-morbidities.
4. Offering short-term potent topical corticosteroid treatment to adults with non-facial localized, non-segmental disease if there are no contraindications.
5. Arranging regular review to assess treatment response and monitor for adverse effects.
6. Arranging further investigation or referral for associated autoimmune disease, if appropriate.
7. Arranging referral to a dermatologist for specialist management if the diagnosis is uncertain, or treatment in primary care is inappropriate or unsuccessful.
8. Offering referral to a skin camouflage service, if appropriate.

Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for localized vitiligo. They are most effective when used on the face, neck, and flexures. The treatment should be continued for at least 3 months, and the response should be assessed after 6 months. Other topical treatments that can be used include calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriol.

In cases of extensive vitiligo, phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) can be used. These treatments can be effective in inducing repigmentation, but they require multiple sessions and can cause adverse effects such as erythema, pruritus, and blistering.

Surgical treatments such as autologous melanocyte transplantation, suction blister grafting, and split-thickness skin grafting can be considered in cases of stable vitiligo that has not responded to other treatments.

What is angle closure glaucoma? Can you explain it as a rap in the style of Eminem?,"Sure, I can explain angle closure glaucoma, but I'm not sure if I can do it in the style of Eminem. I'll give it a try anyway! 🎤

Angle closure glaucoma, let me break it down
It's a type of glaucoma that can make you frown
It happens when the angle between iris and cornea is closed
And the fluid in your eye can't flow, so the pressure goes up, exposed

It's more common in people who are long-sighted, Asian, or old
And if you have a history of blurred vision, headaches, or eye pain, be bold
If you see halos around lights, especially at night
And you feel nausea, vomiting, and your eye is tender and tight

It's a medical emergency, don't wait
Go to the hospital, don't hesitate
They'll give you drops and pills to lower the pressure
And relieve the pain, so you can feel better

If you don't treat it, you can lose your sight
So don't ignore the symptoms, do what's right
See a doctor, get a check-up, and stay healthy
And you'll avoid angle closure glaucoma, that's the key!

"A 4 week old boy has episodes of vomiting since birth. The vomiting occurs soon after feeding. He does not vomit after every feed and it is not related to the amount he takes. He is otherwise well and is gaining weight appropriately.
 
Which is the most likely diagnosis?

Cows milk protein allergy

Gastro-oesophageal reflux

 Lactose intolerance

Pyloric stenosis

Urinary tract infection","The most likely diagnosis for the 4 week old boy with episodes of vomiting since birth, which occurs soon after feeding, is gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). GOR is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus and is considered physiological in infants when symptoms are absent or not troublesome. However, when there are troublesome symptoms (for example discomfort or pain) or complications (such as oesophagitis or pulmonary aspiration) arising from GOR, it is called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD should be suspected in infants presenting with regurgitation and one or more of the following: distressed behaviour shown, for example, by excessive crying, crying while feeding, and adopting unusual neck postures; hoarseness and/or chronic cough; a single episode of pneumonia; unexplained feeding difficulties; and faltering growth. 

In this case, the vomiting occurs soon after feeding, and the baby is otherwise well and gaining weight appropriately. This is consistent with GOR, which usually begins before the age of 8 weeks and resolves in 90% of infants before they are 1 year of age. It is important to note that pyloric stenosis, lactose intolerance, and urinary tract infection are less likely diagnoses in this case, as they do not typically present with vomiting soon after feeding in an otherwise well baby.

Cows milk protein allergy is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism. A diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy should be suspected, particularly if symptoms are multiple, persistent, severe, or treatment-resistant. Typical symptoms include urticaria, angio-oedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, or breathlessness after cow's milk ingestion. A diagnosis of non-IgE-mediated allergy should be suspected if there are one or more symptoms such as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, abdominal discomfort, constipation, diarrhoea, or atopic eczema, particularly if symptoms are treatment-resistant.

Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Symptoms include bloating, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain.

Pyloric stenosis is a condition that affects babies between birth and 6 months of age, where the passage between the stomach and small intestine is blocked by a thickened muscle at the base of the stomach. Symptoms include projectile vomiting, which may be severe, and forceful, and occurs soon after feeding.

Urinary tract infection is an infection in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms include pain or burning during urination, frequent urination, and strong-smelling urine.

Cows milk protein allergy (A) is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism: Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy produces immediate symptoms, which may affect multiple organ systems, typically up to 2 hours after cow's milk ingestion. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy reactions usually manifest between 2 and 72 hours after cow's milk ingestion. Mixed IgE and non-IgE allergic reactions are typically delayed. Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood. Almost all cases present before one year of age. 

Lactose intolerance (C) is a common digestive problem where the body is unable to digest lactose, a type of sugar mainly found in milk and dairy products. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, diarrhoea, and stomach cramps. 

Pyloric stenosis (D) is a condition that affects babies between birth and 6 months of age, where the muscles in the lower part of the stomach enlarge, blocking food from entering the small intestine. Symptoms of pyloric stenosis include forceful vomiting, dehydration, and weight loss. 

Urinary tract infection (E) is an infection that affects any part of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms of urinary tract infection include pain or a burning sensation when urinating, needing to urinate more often than usual, and feeling unwell.

"An 85 year old man has a fall at home and is seen in the Emergency Department. He had incontinence of urine and had been lying on the floor all night. He had a myocardial infarction 8 years ago. He takes aspirin, atorvastatin and ramipril.

His pulse rate is 94 bpm and BP 106/76 mmHg.

Investigations:
White cell count 14.3 × 10⁹/L (3.0–11.0)
Urea 30.4 mmol/L (2.5–7.8)
Creatinine 158 micromol/L (60–120)
Creatinine kinase 11025 U/L (25–200)
ECG: Q waves in lead III.

Which is the most likely cause of his raised creatinine kinase?

Acute kidney injury
Acute myocardial infarction
Dermatomyositis
Rhabdomyolysis
Urinary tract infection","The most likely cause of the raised creatinine kinase in the 85-year-old man who had a fall at home and was seen in the Emergency Department is rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which muscle tissue breaks down rapidly, releasing muscle contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to complications such as acute kidney injury, electrolyte imbalances, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The raised creatinine kinase level is a marker of muscle damage and is commonly seen in rhabdomyolysis. The patient's history of lying on the floor all night and incontinence of urine may have contributed to the development of rhabdomyolysis.

The patient's elevated white cell count and urea level may also be indicative of acute kidney injury, which can be caused by rhabdomyolysis. The patient's history of a myocardial infarction 8 years ago and the presence of Q waves in lead III on ECG suggest that he may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The patient's current medications, including aspirin, atorvastatin, and ramipril, are commonly used to manage cardiovascular disease.

Management of rhabdomyolysis includes identifying and treating the underlying cause, such as immobilization or medication-induced myopathy. Treatment may also include intravenous fluids to prevent acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests that he may have acute kidney injury, which requires further evaluation and management.

How to manage a 56-year-old Caucasian male with hypertension and type 2 diabetes?,"The management of a 56-year-old Caucasian male with hypertension and type 2 diabetes should be individualized, taking into account his age, preferences, co-morbidities, and risks and benefits of treatment. The management should include lifestyle measures, such as diet, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse. The management should also include the management of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

Hypertension management:
The target clinic blood pressure for a 56-year-old Caucasian male with hypertension is below 140/90 mmHg. The management of hypertension includes offering lifestyle advice, including advice on diet and exercise, stress management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (if applicable). The management also includes considering the need for antihypertensive drug treatment, which is initiated in a stepwise approach. The management should also consider the need for statin treatment, following cardiovascular risk assessment. The response to lifestyle changes and drug treatment should be monitored, and the person should be reviewed annually to monitor blood pressure, review medication, provide support, and discuss lifestyle, symptoms, and treatment(s).

Type 2 diabetes management:
The management of type 2 diabetes should include ensuring the person has an individualized care plan, taking into account their age, preferences, co-morbidities, and risks and benefits of treatment. The management should also include offering adults referral to a structured group education programme, and ensuring children are referred to a multidisciplinary diabetes team for confirmation of the diagnosis and ongoing management. The management should advise on sources of information and support, and advise on always wearing or carrying some form of diabetes identification. The management should also advise on how to manage intercurrent illness and 'sick-day rules'. The management should assess for associated psychosocial problems and offer support. The management should advise on sexual health, contraception, and pre-pregnancy counselling, if appropriate. The management should also offer immunization against influenza and pneumococcal infection, if indicated. The management should advise on the importance of regular HbA1c monitoring, antidiabetic drug treatment (if appropriate), and individualized treatment targets, to reduce the risk of long-term complications. The management should advise against routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. The management should also advise on the importance of regular screening for complications, how to reduce risk, and offering management as appropriate.

The management should include lifestyle measures, such as diet, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse. The following are the steps to manage a 56-year-old Caucasian male with hypertension and type 2 diabetes:

1. Diagnosis: Suspect a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes if there is persistent hyperglycaemia. Hypertension should be suspected if clinic systolic blood pressure is sustained above or equal to 140 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure is sustained above or equal to 90 mmHg, or both. The diagnosis is then confirmed with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM).

2. Assessment: While waiting for confirmation of a diagnosis of hypertension, the person should be offered investigations for target organ damage and for secondary causes of hypertension. Assessment of cardiovascular risk should also be done.

3. Management: The management of a person with type 2 diabetes and hypertension should include:

- Ensuring they have an individualized care plan, taking into account their age, preferences, co-morbidities, and risks and benefits of treatment.
- Offering adults referral to a structured group education programme, and ensuring children are referred to a multidisciplinary diabetes team for confirmation of the diagnosis and ongoing management.
- Advising on sources of information and support.
- Advising on always wearing or carrying some form of diabetes identification.
- Advising on lifestyle measures, such as diet, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse.
- Advising on how to manage intercurrent illness and 'sick-day rules'.

- Advising against routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.
- Advising on the importance of regular screening for complications, how to reduce risk, and offering management as appropriate.
- Ensuring young people are supported in the transition from paediatric to adult services.

4. Drug treatment: Antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated in a stepwise approach. Statin treatment should be offered for the primary prevention of CVD to people with an estimated 10 year CVD risk of 10% or more if lifestyle interventions have not proved effective. Over time, some people with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy as there is insufficient endogenous insulin to maintain adequate blood glucose control.

Which anti-hypertensives should be given to a 56-year-old Caucasian male with type-2 diabetes and hypertension?,"For a 56-year-old Caucasian male with type-2 diabetes and hypertension, the management should include offering lifestyle advice, including advice on diet and exercise, stress management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (if applicable). The need for antihypertensive drug treatment should be considered, which is initiated in a stepwise approach. The need for statin treatment should also be considered, following cardiovascular risk assessment. Monitoring response to lifestyle changes and drug treatment is essential. The person should be reviewed annually to monitor blood pressure, review medication, provide support, and discuss lifestyle, symptoms, and treatment(s).

The main indications for antiplatelets are the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in people with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), angina, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and atrial fibrillation (AF) (although anticoagulants are usually used). Antiplatelet treatment for secondary prevention of CVD should be prescribed for people with angina, ACS which is medically managed, PCI for people with ACS, PCI in people with stable coronary artery disease, stroke, or TIA. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily is the preferred antiplatelet for stroke or TIA. Modified-release dipyridamole (200 mg twice a day) should be prescribed with combined with aspirin 75 mg if clopidogrel is unsuitable. PAD or multivascular disease, clopidogrel 75 mg daily is the preferred antiplatelet. Aspirin 75 mg alone should be prescribed if clopidogrel is unsuitable.

For hypertension, the target clinic blood pressure for age under 80 years is below 140/90 mmHg; ABPM/HBPM below 135/85 mmHg. For age 80 years and older, the target clinic blood pressure is below 150/90 mmHg; ABPM/HBPM below 145/85 mmHg.

For hypertension, the management should include offering investigations for target organ damage and for secondary causes of hypertension, assessment of cardiovascular risk, and referral for same-day specialist assessment for people with a clinic blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg and higher with signs of retinal haemorrhage or papilloedema (accelerated hypertension) or life-threatening symptoms. The antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated in a stepwise approach, and the target clinic blood pressure should be below 140/90 mmHg for age under 80 years. 

Therefore, for a 56-year-old Caucasian male with type-2 diabetes and hypertension, the antiplatelet treatment should be aspirin 75 mg for angina, and for hypertension, the antihypertensive drug treatment should be initiated in a stepwise approach, and the target clinic blood pressure should be below 140/90 mmHg for age under 80 years.

How to manage a 56-year-old Caucasian male with type-2 diabetes and hypertension?,"The management of a 56-year-old Caucasian male with type-2 diabetes and hypertension should be individualized, taking into account his age, preferences, co-morbidities, and risks and benefits of treatment. The management should include:

- Ensuring the patient has an individualized care plan.
- Offering referral to a structured group education program.
- Advising on sources of information and support.
- Advising on lifestyle measures, such as diet, exercise and physical activity, weight loss, smoking, alcohol, and drug misuse.
- Advising on how to manage intercurrent illness and 'sick-day rules'.
- Assessing for associated psychosocial problems and offering support.
- Advising on sexual health, contraception, and pre-pregnancy counseling, if appropriate.
- Offering immunization against influenza and pneumococcal infection, if indicated.
- Advising on the importance of regular HbA1c monitoring, antidiabetic drug treatment (if appropriate), and individualized treatment targets, to reduce the risk of long-term complications.
- Advising against routine self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.
- Advising on the importance of regular screening for complications, how to reduce risk, and offering management as appropriate.
- Offering lifestyle advice, including advice on diet and exercise, stress management, alcohol consumption, and smoking cessation (if applicable).
- Considering the need for antihypertensive drug treatment, which is initiated in a stepwise approach.
- Considering the need for statin treatment, following cardiovascular risk assessment.
- Monitoring response to lifestyle changes and drug treatment.
- Reviewing the person annually to monitor blood pressure, review medication, provide support, and discuss lifestyle, symptoms, and treatment(s).

"A 4 week old boy has episodes of vomiting since birth. The vomiting occurs soon after feeding. He does not vomit after every feed and it is not related to the amount he takes. He is otherwise well and is gaining weight appropriately.

 Lactose intolerance

Pyloric stenosis

Gastro-oesophageal reflux

 Lactose intolerance

Pyloric stenosis

Urinary tract infection","Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the 4-week-old boy with episodes of vomiting since birth is gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). GOR is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus, and it is considered physiological in infants when symptoms are absent or not troublesome. However, GORD in children is the presence of troublesome symptoms (for example discomfort or pain) or complications (such as oesophagitis or pulmonary aspiration) arising from GOR. The vomiting occurs soon after feeding, and it is not related to the amount he takes. This is a common symptom of GOR, which usually begins before the age of 8 weeks and resolves in 90% of infants before they are 1 year of age. 

Cows milk protein allergy is also a possibility, but it is less likely based on the given information. Cow's milk allergy is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism. Immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated food allergy produces immediate symptoms, which may affect multiple organ systems, typically up to 2 hours after cow's milk ingestion. Non-IgE-mediated food allergy reactions usually manifest between 2 and 72 hours after cow's milk ingestion. Mixed IgE and non-IgE allergic reactions are typically delayed. The boy's vomiting occurs soon after feeding, which is not consistent with the typical presentation of cow's milk allergy.

Lactose intolerance is also less likely as it is a rare condition in infants. Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is caused by a deficiency of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose in the small intestine. Symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating, gas, and diarrhea, which are not consistent with the boy's symptoms.

Pyloric stenosis is also less likely as it usually presents after the age of 3 weeks. Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the muscle at the bottom of the stomach (pylorus) becomes thickened, blocking the flow of food into the small intestine. Symptoms of pyloric stenosis include forceful vomiting, which occurs after every feeding, and weight loss, which are not consistent with the boy's symptoms.

Urinary tract infection is unlikely as it does not present with vomiting as the main symptom. Urinary tract infection is an infection in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms of urinary tract infection include fever, irritability, and poor feeding, which are not consistent with the boy's symptoms.

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus. It is considered physiological in infants when symptoms are absent or not troublesome. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in children is the presence of troublesome symptoms (for example discomfort or pain) or complications (such as oesophagitis or pulmonary aspiration) arising from GOR. GORD should be suspected in infants presenting with regurgitation and one or more of the following: distressed behaviour shown, for example, by excessive crying, crying while feeding, and adopting unusual neck postures; hoarseness and/or chronic cough; a single episode of pneumonia; unexplained feeding difficulties; and faltering growth. GORD usually begins before the age of 8 weeks and resolves in 90% of infants before they are 1 year of age. 

Cows milk protein allergy is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism. Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood. Almost all cases present before one year of age. Typical symptoms include urticaria, angio-oedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, or breathlessness after cow's milk ingestion. 

Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is caused by a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme produced by the cells lining the small intestine. Symptoms include bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. 

Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the muscle between the stomach and small intestine (pylorus) becomes thickened, blocking the passage of food. Symptoms include projectile vomiting, which may occur soon after feeding or up to an hour later, and weight loss. It usually presents between 3 and 5 weeks of age. 

Urinary tract infection is an infection of the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms include fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhoea. It is uncommon in infants under 2 months of age.

Which medications are contraindicated in asthma?,"There are no contraindications to the use of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma. However, care should be taken in people with active (untreated) or quiescent tuberculosis, or untreated fungal, bacterial, parasitic, or systemic viral infections, or ocular herpes simplex. 

NSAIDs are not contraindicated in asthma, but they should be used with caution in people with asthma, particularly in those with nasal polyps, chronic rhinosinusitis, or a history of asthma exacerbations with NSAID use. 

Oral corticosteroids are not contraindicated in asthma, but they should be used with caution in people with hepatic impairment; psychiatric disturbance including psychoses or severe affective disorders; wounds; other pre-existing conditions that can be exacerbated by oral corticosteroids, such as heart failure, diabetes mellitus, recent myocardial infarction, or hypertension.
