How to manage vitilligo?,"Management of vitiligo depends on the person's age, disease subtype, distribution, activity, and extent. The aim of management is to improve the appearance of the skin and to prevent further depigmentation. The following are the management options for vitiligo:

1. Providing advice on sources of information and support.
2. Advising on sun protection.
3. Managing any psychosocial co-morbidities.
4. Offering short-term potent topical corticosteroid treatment to adults with non-facial localized, non-segmental disease if there are no contraindications.
5. Arranging regular review to assess treatment response and monitor for adverse effects.
6. Arranging further investigation or referral for associated autoimmune disease, if appropriate.
7. Arranging referral to a dermatologist for specialist management if the diagnosis is uncertain, or treatment in primary care is inappropriate or unsuccessful.
8. Offering referral to a skin camouflage service, if appropriate.

Topical corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for localized vitiligo. They are most effective when used on the face, neck, and flexures. The treatment should be continued for at least 3 months, and the response should be assessed after 6 months. Other topical treatments that can be used include calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, and vitamin D analogues, such as calcipotriol.

In cases of extensive vitiligo, phototherapy with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) can be used. These treatments can be effective in inducing repigmentation, but they require multiple sessions and can cause adverse effects such as erythema, pruritus, and blistering.

Surgical treatments such as autologous melanocyte transplantation, suction blister grafting, and split-thickness skin grafting can be considered in cases of stable vitiligo that has not responded to other treatments.","

What is angle closure glaucoma? Can you explain it as a rap in the style of Eminem?,"Sure, I can explain angle closure glaucoma, but I'm not sure if I can do it in the style of Eminem. I'll give it a try anyway! ðŸŽ¤

Angle closure glaucoma, let me break it down
It's a type of glaucoma that can make you frown
It happens when the angle between iris and cornea is closed
And the fluid in your eye can't flow, so the pressure goes up, exposed

It's more common in people who are long-sighted, Asian, or old
And if you have a history of blurred vision, headaches, or eye pain, be bold
If you see halos around lights, especially at night
And you feel nausea, vomiting, and your eye is tender and tight

It's a medical emergency, don't wait
Go to the hospital, don't hesitate
They'll give you drops and pills to lower the pressure
And relieve the pain, so you can feel better

If you don't treat it, you can lose your sight
So don't ignore the symptoms, do what's right
See a doctor, get a check-up, and stay healthy
And you'll avoid angle closure glaucoma, that's the key!

"A 4 week old boy has episodes of vomiting since birth. The vomiting occurs soon after feeding. He does not vomit after every feed and it is not related to the amount he takes. He is otherwise well and is gaining weight appropriately.
 
Which is the most likely diagnosis?

Cows milk protein allergy

Gastro-oesophageal reflux

 Lactose intolerance

Pyloric stenosis

Urinary tract infection","Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR). 

Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus. It is considered physiological in infants when symptoms are absent or not troublesome. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in children is the presence of troublesome symptoms (for example discomfort or pain) or complications (such as oesophagitis or pulmonary aspiration) arising from GOR. GORD should be suspected in infants presenting with regurgitation and one or more of the following: distressed behaviour shown, for example, by excessive crying, crying while feeding, and adopting unusual neck postures; hoarseness and/or chronic cough; a single episode of pneumonia; unexplained feeding difficulties; and faltering growth. GORD usually begins before the age of 8 weeks and resolves in 90% of infants before they are 1 year of age. 

Cows milk protein allergy is a reproducible immune-mediated allergic response to one or more proteins in cow's milk. It can be classified according to the underlying immune mechanism. Cow's milk allergy is one of the most common presentations of food allergy seen in early childhood. Almost all cases present before one year of age. Typical symptoms include urticaria, angio-oedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, or breathlessness after cow's milk ingestion. 

Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. It is caused by a deficiency of lactase, an enzyme produced by the cells lining the small intestine. Symptoms include bloating, flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. 

Pyloric stenosis is a condition in which the muscle between the stomach and small intestine (pylorus) becomes thickened, blocking the passage of food. It usually presents in the first few weeks of life with projectile vomiting, weight loss, and dehydration. 

Urinary tract infection is an infection in any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Symptoms include fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhoea.","

"A 66 year old man has tiredness and low back pain for 2 months. He has type 2 diabetes and hypertension and takes metformin and ramipril. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol.
His pulse rate is 88 bpm and BP 138/82mmHg. Clinical examination is normal.

Investigations:
Haemoglobin 78 g/L (130â€“175)
White cell count 3.4 Ã— 109/L (3.0â€“10.0)
Platelet count 80 Ã— 109/L (150â€“400)

X-ray of lumbar spine: generalised osteopenia and vertebral collapse at multiple levels.

Which is the most appropriate next investigation?

Serum angiotensin converting enzyme

Serum parathyroid hormone

Serum prostate specific antigen

Serum protein electrophoresis

Serum vitamin D","The most appropriate next investigation for this 66-year-old man with a 2-month history of tiredness and low back pain, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and recent investigations showing haemoglobin of 78 g/L (130â€“175), white cell count of 3.4 Ã— 109/L (3.0â€“10.0), platelet count of 80 Ã— 109/L (150â€“400), corrected calcium of 2.71 mmol/L (2.2â€“2.6), albumin of 36 g/L (35â€“50) and X-ray of lumbar spine with generalised osteopenia and vertebral collapse at multiple levels, would be Serum protein electrophoresis.
 
This investigation will assess for myeloma, which is consistent with this patientâ€™s presentation. According to the referral guidelines by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), referral for haematological cancer is recommended in people aged 60 and over with persistent bone pain, especially back pain, or unexplained fracture. Investigations include a full blood count, blood tests for calcium and plasma viscosity, serum electrophoresis, serum-free light-chain assay, and Bence-Jones protein urine assessment. Therefore, serum protein electrophoresis should confirm the diagnosis of myeloma as a possible cause of the patient's multiple vertebral fractures and other symptoms. 

It is essential to start investigations based on the clinical suspicion of a possible cause of illness to make the right diagnosis as early as possible. This will enable healthcare providers to provide appropriate care and management.

What is the drug of choice in Restless Leg Syndrome? Gabapentin or Ropinirole?,"The first-line recommended drug options for people with frequent or daily symptoms of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) are either a non-ergot dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, or rotigotine) or an alpha-2-delta ligand (pregabalin or gabapentin - both off-label indications). However, factors that may influence the preferred choice of drug include:

- A dopamine-receptor agonist is generally preferred for people with severe symptoms, who are obese, have comorbid depression, are at increased risk of falls, or have cognitive impairment.
- An alpha-2-delta ligand is generally preferred for people with severe sleep disturbance (disproportionate to other RLS symptoms), comorbid insomnia or anxiety, RLS-related or comorbid pain, or a history of an impulse control disorder.
- Rotigotine transdermal patch, a dopamine agonist, may be considered if the person has significant daytime symptoms as it has a long duration of action.

It is essential to ensure that the person is fully informed and aware of the possible treatment complications related to dopamine agonists, particularly the risks of augmentation and an impulse control disorder (ICD). Treatment for idiopathic RLS aims to control symptoms and is likely to be lifelong. However, to determine whether a remission or easing of symptoms has occurred, short drug holidays every year are reasonable. Hence, the choice of drug for the treatment of RLS will depend on the severity of the individual's symptoms, comorbid conditions, and personal preferences.

"An 8 year old girl has a frequent cough at night and mild exercise-induced wheeze for 3 months. She has asthma and takes low-dose inhaled corticosteroids twice daily and a short-acting bronchodilator as required. She takes her treatment as recommended. Her inhaler technique is good.

Which is the most appropriate next step in her treatment?

Add leukotriene receptor antagonist
Add oral modified release theophylline
Add short course of oral corticosteroid
Increase dose of inhaled corticosteroid
Increase frequency of short acting bronchodilator","Based on the provided context, considering adherence before recommending increasing ICS as patients who are highly adherent may have a ceiling effect and gain no additional benefit from increasing ICS at the onset of an attack, the most appropriate next step in the treatment of an 8-year-old girl with frequent cough and mild exercise-induced wheeze for 3 months, who takes low-dose inhaled corticosteroids twice daily and a short-acting bronchodilator as required, is to add a leukotriene receptor antagonist.

Leukotriene receptor antagonists are recommended as a therapeutic trial after increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Based on the provided information, the patient is already taking low-dose ICS, and a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene receptor antagonist may be the most appropriate next step in the treatment.

What advice should I give to a 6-year-old girl with head lice?,"As an AI assistant, I would advise a 6-year-old girl with head lice to use one of the following treatments after carefully considering preferences or contraindications and treatment cost:

- Physical insecticide, such as dimeticone 4% lotion (HedrinÂ®)
- Traditional insecticide, such as malathion 0.5% aqueous liquid (Derbac-MÂ®).
- Wet combing with a fine-toothed head louse comb (such as theÂ Bug BusterÂ® comb).

It is important to note that all affected household members should also undergo treatment on the same day, and the treatment should be performed correctly. Detection combing should be done after all treatments to confirm the success of treatment. 

Additionally, here are some general advice regarding head lice that should be given to the girl:

- Children being treated for head lice can still attend school.
- There is no evidence that head lice have a preference for either clean or dirty hair.
- No need to wash clothing or bedding that has been in contact with lice at high temperature or fumigate.
- Essential oil-based treatments and herbal treatments are not recommended for lack of good-quality evidence on their safety and efficacy.
- Children of primary school age should be examined regularly at home (using a detection comb) to identify infestations early.
- Measured beyond normal personal hygiene, house cleaning, and laundry are not necessary to prevent head lice transmission.

It is important to note that the best way to confirm lice infestation is through the systematic examination of hair using a fine-toothed head lice detection comb. All advice and treatment plans should be done with the consent and guidance of the girl's parent, carer or guardian.

mortality after a neck of femur fracture,"The mortality rate after a neck of femur fracture is high. Following a hip fracture, there is a substantial increase in one-year mortality, which ranges from 18â€“33%. Sudden inability to bear weight due to this fracture requires urgent referral to orthopedics. The increased risk of mortality is partly due to pre-existing comorbidity. Hip fracture is fatal in approximately 20% of cases. A hip fracture is associated with permanent recovery in only 30% of cases, and 50% of cases that require hospitalization cause permanent disability. It is important to note that these figures may differ based on the person's age, the presence of other health conditions, and their general health.
