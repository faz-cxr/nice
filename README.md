## üìö Technical description

Question-Answering has the following steps, all handled by [RetrievalQAWithSourcesChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/vector_db_qa_with_sources.html):

1. Given a user question, look up relevant documents from the vectorstore using Embeddings and similarity search.
2. Determine what a standalone question would be (using GPT-3.5-turbo).
3. Pass the standalone question and relevant documents to GPT-3.5-turbo to generate a final answer.
